# Diagramming with Mermaid

Let's have some fun building diagrams.

Let's see if the system is working. A simple test diagram:

## How to create and document a domain  model

Markup legend for a `classDiagram`:
- `--` represents a bidirectional association between two entities. Those entities can exist individually without knowing one about the other. Peer entities that might work together and hold references from one to the other.
- `-->` represents a directional association between two entities. Those entities can exist individually without knowing one about the other. But in this case just one entity can hold a reference to the other entity. The other one can never hold a reference to the other entity.
- `0--` represents an aggregation association. Entities linked by aggregation can still exist independently. But one is a parent which is linked to a child. If the parent entity is deleted, the child can still remain and live on independently.
- `*--` represents a composition association. Entities linked by composition have the closest relationship. Like aggregations, there is a parent. If the parent is deleted the child is also deleted. A child entity here makes no sense without a parent.
- `--|>` represents an inheritance association. It goes from the subclass to the template. 
- `:` can be used at the end of any of the above associations to add descriptions. Descriptions can be used on any flows through the diagram.
- `"1"`, `"1..*"`, `"0..*"` are ways of adding multiplicity to the relationships. Known as cardinality. Use them on each side to annotate the diagram, or just on one side of the relationship. An entityâ€™s cardinality is defined on the opposite side of the relationship, which can be confusing to begin with.
- `%%`  is used to comment lines of the diagram. Nice!
- `link NODE_NAME LINK_URL _blank` to generate a clickable link on the name of the entity.

The above markup can be used to generate something like...


### Streamy Domain Model

```mermaid
classDiagram
    Title "1..*" -- "1..*" Genre: is associated with
    Title "1" *-- "0..*" Season: has
    Title "1" *-- "0..*" Review: has
    Title "0..*" o-- "1..*" Actor: features
        
    TV Show --|> Title: implements
    Short --|> Title: implements
    Film --|> Title: implements
    
    Viewer "0..*" --> "0..*" Title: watches
    
    Season "1" *-- "0..*" Review: has
    Season "1" *-- "1..*" Episode: contains
    
    Episode "1" *-- "0..*" Review: has
    
    link Title "http://www.example.com" _blank
```

Let's try another one...

### School Domain Model

```mermaid
classDiagram
    Teacher "1..*" -- "1..*" Student: is associated with
    Teacher "1" o-- "0..*" Class: teaches
    
    Student "1" o-- "1..*" Class: enrolled
    
    Class "1" *-- "0..*" Grade: has
    
    link Teacher "http://www.example.com/teacher" _blank
    link Student "http://www.example.com/student" _blank
    link Class "http://www.example.com/class" _blank
    link Grade "http://www.example.com/grade" _blank
```
## How to visualise application and user flows

Sequence diagrams are high-level views of a process, so try to keep the labels high-level too.

Markup legend for `sequenceDiagram`
- `actor` defines an actor. An actor represents a human user.
- `participant` defines a participant. A participant represents a process. You can define aliases for participants like so `participant SUS as Sign Up Service`. When defining messages between participants, you can then use the shorter alias rather than its full name, which will still be rendered on the diagram.
- `->>` defines a synchronous interaction between two sequence diagram nodes which is a message. It is a request.
- `-->>` defines a reply message interaction. It is a response.
- `alt SOME_TAG_NAME` then `else TAG_NAME` and `end` to define branching logic in a diagram. You can use as many `else` as you need to define more branches.

### User Signup Flow Diagram

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    actor Browser
    participant Sign Up Service
    participant User Service
    participant Kafka
    
    Browser ->> Sign Up Service: GET /sign_up
    Sign Up Service -->> Browser: 200 OK (HTML page)
    
    Browser ->> Sign Up Service: POST /sign_up
    Sign Up Service ->> Sign Up Service: Validate input
    
    alt invalid input
        Sign Up Service -->> Browser: Error
    else valid input
        Sign Up Service ->> User Service: POST /users
        User Service -->> Sign Up Service: 201 Created (User)
        Sign Up Service -->> Browser: 301 Redirect (Login Page)
    end
```
